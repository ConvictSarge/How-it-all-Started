Well, for those of you that don’t or haven’t known me personally… I am out of work for the foreseeable future due to a motorcycle injury. I have decided to take this time away from work to beef up some of my skills to seek other employment. I am currently a Correctional Officer Sergeant. While I do enjoy the work, I have, as of late, seen some errors, so to speak. I have decided that remote work, and time with my family is more important than all the hours I have spent away from them over the years. So I said to myself, “Self, what are you capable of?”
<br />
<br />
Well, I remember a time long long ago… My 7th Christmas opening a Commodore 64, yes, I’m that old, with 5.25” floppy drive, and dot-matrix printer. Man, that was amazing. Over the next couple years I found myself learning Basic programming to make my computer do what I wanted. My grand-father worked for a big construction company, and over the years he would make sure to buy me a computer that they were getting rid of. My first one of these used an Intel 386 chip. Gosh have we come a long way. I remember breaking and fixing that thing so many many times. And the upgrades, video cards, zip drives, modems. You could imagine the fun a preteen / teen had with bulletin boards. And then… the malware and viruses, AOL chat kicks, lime wire, torrents, Ubuntu, etc. Through out the years I’ve already developed a healthy set of skills. Between programming, operating systems (both computer and phone), hardware, networking, I have a firm basic knowledge of IT.
<br />
<br />
So, you’d think with all of this being done almost as a hobby, I would have found myself firmly already planted in an IT. department. Ha, no. I decided to take the glorious route of physical security, in almost every facet. Currently as stated before, working in a state prison. Lately, things just aren’t meshing well with that career and my home/personal life, so changes need to be made. My life goals and family goals aren’t aligned with that field any more. So, “Self”, what can I do to meet my goals, with a skill set that I already have?
<br />
<br />
<p align="center"><b>And the answer is, Cybersecurity!</b></p>
<br />
<br />
Yes, I know that is a hot button key word of an industry right now. Yes, I know my skills and knowledge don’t quite match the qualifications. Yes, I know that I have some work and learning to do. But, guess what? I’m laid up for about 2 months due to this injury. Plenty of full time dedicated time.
<br />
<br />
Where to start? Well, Coursera has an online learning for a Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate that comes with a discount voucher for the COMPTIA Security+ exam. That sounds like a good place to start with the education. Now for the physical ‘doing’ of things. Well, home-labs provide training, and my Google Drive is 99% full. How about a web server on AWS to get some technical skills started.
<br />
<br />
And so, the journey begins.
